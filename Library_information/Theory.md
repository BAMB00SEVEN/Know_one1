# Day 2: Timing, Synthesis, and Sequential Logic

Welcome to the theoretical deep dive for Day 2. This session focuses on the foundational concepts that bridge your RTL code with physical reality: timing libraries that characterize standard cells, synthesis strategies that transform your design, and the correct way to model state-holding elements like flip-flops.

## 1. Understanding Timing Libraries (`.lib`)

A **Timing Library** is a critical file in the ASIC design flow. It's an ASCII file that contains detailed electrical and timing information about every standard cell in a specific Process Design Kit (PDK). Synthesis and timing analysis tools rely on this file to understand how to build and validate the circuit.

### ► The SKY130 PDK Library: `sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib`

The filename itself is a compact specification of the conditions under which the cell characteristics were measured. This is known as a **PVT (Process, Voltage, Temperature) corner**.

* **`tt`**: Represents the **Typical-Typical** process corner. This is the nominal or expected manufacturing process, not the fastest or slowest.
* **`025C`**: Specifies a temperature of **25° C**. Cell performance (e.g., switching speed) is highly dependent on temperature.
* **`1v80`**: Indicates a core operating voltage of **1.80V**.

These corners are essential because a chip must function correctly across a range of possible manufacturing variations, operating voltages, and temperatures.

## 2. Synthesis Strategies: Hierarchical vs. Flattened

Synthesis is the process of converting high-level RTL (Verilog/VHDL) into a gate-level netlist. The strategy you choose affects optimization, runtime, and debuggability.

### ► Hierarchical Synthesis

This approach preserves the modular structure (`module` boundaries) from your original RTL code. The synthesis tool works on each module individually before connecting them.

* **Core Idea**: Keep the design partitioned as you wrote it.
* **Advantages**:
    * **Faster Runtimes**: Ideal for large designs, as smaller parts can be synthesized independently, sometimes in parallel.
    * **Easier Debugging**: Errors can be traced back to the specific module where they occurred. The final netlist is more readable and aligns with the RTL structure.
    * **Modularity**: Facilitates team-based projects and the reuse of IP blocks.
* **Disadvantages**:
    * **Limited Optimization**: The tool cannot perform optimizations across module boundaries. A critical path that spans two modules might not be optimized as effectively as it could be.

### ► Flattened Synthesis

This approach collapses the entire design hierarchy into a single, massive module before running optimizations.

* **Core Idea**: View the design as one giant sea of logic gates.
* **Advantages**:
    * **Maximum Optimization**: The tool has full visibility of the entire design and can perform aggressive, cross-boundary optimizations, potentially leading to better performance and area.
* **Disadvantages**:
    * **Slower Runtimes**: For large designs, processing a single, enormous netlist can be computationally intensive and consume significant memory.
    * **Difficult Debugging**: The direct correlation between the original RTL modules and the final gate-level netlist is lost, making it challenging to trace signals and debug issues.

### ► At a Glance: Key Differences

| Aspect             | Hierarchical Synthesis             | Flattened Synthesis                     |
| :----------------- | :--------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------- |
| **Hierarchy** | Preserved                          | Collapsed into a single entity          |
| **Optimization** | Local (within modules)             | Global (across the entire design)       |
| **Runtime** | Generally faster for large designs | Can be very slow for large designs      |
| **Debugging** | Easier, maps directly to RTL       | Difficult, structure is lost            |
| **Primary Use Case** | Large, complex designs, modularity | Smaller designs or when max performance is critical |

## 3. Flip-Flop Coding Styles

Flip-flops are the fundamental memory elements in synchronous digital circuits. The way you code them determines their reset/set behavior.

### ► Asynchronous vs. Synchronous Resets

The key difference lies in the `always` block's sensitivity list.

* **Asynchronous**: The reset is sensitive to the *edge* of the reset signal itself (`posedge async_reset`). This means the reset can happen at *any time*, regardless of the clock. It is immediate and overrides the clock.
* **Synchronous**: The reset condition is checked only on the *active edge of the clock*. The reset signal is just another data input that is sampled when the clock ticks. The output only changes on the clock edge.

### ► Common Flip-Flop Implementations

> **Asynchronous Reset D Flip-Flop**
> The `always @ (posedge clk, posedge async_reset)` sensitivity list is the defining feature. The `if (async_reset)` check must be the first statement to ensure it has priority.

> **Asynchronous Set D Flip-Flop**
> Similar to the asynchronous reset, but the output `q` is forced to `1'b1` when the set signal is active. The sensitivity list includes `posedge async_set`.

> **Synchronous Reset D Flip-Flop**
> The sensitivity list *only* contains the clock edge: `always @ (posedge clk)`. The reset condition is checked inside the block like any other synchronous logic.
